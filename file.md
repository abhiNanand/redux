Yes! VS Code's default text editor for `.txt` files is very basic, but you can enhance the experience using extensions. Here are a few ways to improve it:

### **1. Use Markdown Instead of Plain Text (`.md` files)**
If you want formatting (bold, italics, headings, etc.), consider using **Markdown** instead of `.txt`. Markdown is simple, readable, and supported natively in VS Code with a **preview mode**.

- Change `.txt` to `.md`
- Install the **Markdown Preview Enhanced** extension
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + V` to preview your notes in a styled format.

### **2. Use a Rich Text Editor Extension**
If you want a **WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)** editor inside VS Code, try these extensions:

- 📜 **"Text Power Tools"** – Adds better text-editing capabilities.
- 📝 **"RTF Editor"** – Allows rich text formatting.
- ✍️ **"Markdown All in One"** – Great for Markdown-based notes with better visuals.

### **3. Change Font Size & Appearance for `.txt` Files**
If you just want to **increase font size and improve visibility**, you can change VS Code settings:

- Open **Settings** (`Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,` on Mac).
- Search for **Editor: Font Size** and increase it.
- Search for **Editor: Word Wrap** and enable it for better readability.

You can also install **"Custom CSS and JS Loader"** to customize how text files look inside VS Code.

### **4. Use a Note-Taking Extension**
For a better note-taking experience, try:

- 📓 **"Dendron"** – A powerful note-taking tool inside VS Code.
- 📖 **"Foam"** – Like Obsidian but inside VS Code.
